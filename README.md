# A/B Testing and Statistical Analysis on UCI ML Dataset

This project applies A/B testing and statistical analysis techniques on a dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository to evaluate the effectiveness of experimental changes in user or system behavior.

## Dataset

- **Source:** [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/)
- **Dataset Used:** [Insert dataset name here, e.g., Bank Marketing Dataset]
- **Features:** Includes customer demographics, behavior metrics, and response labels.

## Objective

To simulate and analyze an A/B test by:
- Dividing the data into control (Group A) and test (Group B)
- Performing statistical hypothesis testing
- Interpreting results to determine if observed differences are significant

## Methods Used

- Descriptive statistics and visualizations
- Independent t-tests and proportion z-tests
- Confidence interval estimation
- p-value interpretation and effect size calculation

## Tools

- Python (pandas, numpy, scipy, matplotlib, seaborn, statsmodels)
- Jupyter Notebook

## Results Summary

- The test group (Group B) outperformed the control group
- Statistical significance achieved (e.g., p < 0.05)
- Based on results, Group B's version is recommended

## Getting Started
